# Run++
## An open-source, improved Run dialog replacement.
Run++ is an open source replacement for the Windows run dialog. It is in **very VERY** early development,
but many basic things work.

You can:
- Run files, either using the button or by pressing Enter,
- Run files as administrator either using the button or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter,
- Or Use the browse button to easily locate a file

You can't:
- **Run stuff from PATH** (this means no "`cmd.exe`", you have to type "`C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`")
- Run as another user
- Replace Win+R with this (I don't know how!)

### Download
I do not recommend using this over the Win+R dialog (at least for now!!!),
but if you want to try it, head over to the releases by clicking [here](https://github.com/cainy-a/RunPlusPlus/releases).
